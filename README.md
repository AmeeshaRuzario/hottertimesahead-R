Overview
This project focuses on analyzing temperature data to gain insights into climate change. It includes various data analysis and visualization operations to understand temperature trends over time.

#Data Source
The temperature data used for this analysis is sourced from the provided CSV file: Indian Summers - Over the years-2007-11.csv.

#Operations
1. Display All Data from CSV
To display all the data from the CSV file, you can use your preferred data analysis tool or programming language.

2. Check for Null Values
You can perform data validation operations to check if there are any null values in the dataset.

3. Count Null Values
Calculate the number of null values in the dataset to identify missing data points.

4. Calculate the Mean of 'feelslikemax' for Each 'City'
To understand how 'feelslikemax' varies across different cities, calculate the mean value for this variable for each city. Sort the results in descending order and reset the index if needed.

5. Calculate the Mean of 'tempmax' for Each 'City'
Similarly, calculate the mean of 'tempmax' for each city to analyze temperature trends across different regions. Sort the results in descending order and reset the index as necessary.

6. Create Bar Plots with a Built-in Color Palette
Use data visualization tools to create bar plots that visually represent the calculated means. Apply built-in color palettes to make the plots visually appealing and informative.
